# Hooks

These should be camelCase.

They are React hooks https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks, not WP hooks or WP hooks or WP hooks

...Except block hooks come in WP 6.4 and are php based, so is this confusing?

they should be avoided? https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/7712#issuecomment-479441171


There are two types of hooks: Actions and Filters. In addition to PHP actions and filters, WordPress also provides a mechanism for registering and executing hooks in JavaScript. This functionality is also available on npm as the @wordpress/hooks package, for general purpose use.

You can also learn more about both APIs: PHP and JavaScript. (it's all php...)
