# `fetchMedia`

The `fetchMedia` hook is a simple helper to quickly get something from the WordPress Media Library. It accepts the `id` of the media element as it's only parameter and returns an object containing the media object itself (`media`), whether it is still loading (`isResolvingMedia`), and whether it has finished resolving (`hasResolvedMedia`).
